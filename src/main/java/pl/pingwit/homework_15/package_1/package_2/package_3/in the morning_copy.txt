[Chorus]
Summer ends, but you're not here
I fake a smile just to hide the tears
And all my friends say I should let go
So how could you love me and leave me in the morning?

[Verse 1]
I wake up with your voice in my head
Your voice, what they said, "Don't cry"
Take off your clothes in my bed and ghost me like that
Oh why?

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm getting fucked up and I'm alone and drunk
You'll always be the reason
So I can tell you, "Good luck"
Go break another man's heart
Goddamn I hate this season

[Chorus]
Summer ends, but you're not here
I fake a smile just to hide the tears
And all my friends say I should let go
So how could you love me and leave me in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
Can't you see I'm falling?
So how could you love me and leave me in the morning?

[Verse 2]
I hold on but you're pushing me out
Say we're good, but I'm not okay
I know you only stay to get high
I'm still wasting my life away

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm getting fucked up and I'm alone and drunk
You'll always be the reason
So I can tell you, "Good luck"
Go break another man's heart
Goddamn I hate this season

[Chorus]
Summer ends, but you're not here
I fake a smile just to hide the tears
And all my friends say I should let go
So how could you love me and leave me in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
Can't you see I'm falling?
So how could you love me and leave me in the morning?

[Outro]
So how could you love me and leave me in the morning?
